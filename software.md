I have started to make the code I write [publicly available in git repositories](https://github.com/joeweaver). The software published there ranges in complexity, but I very much agree with the stance that sharing code whenever possible strengthens academia.

Points of (possible) interest include:

* an [application](https://github.com/joeweaver/tidysol) to create sensibly formatted text from a commercial CFD program's exported data
* an [ImageJ macro and example code](https://github.com/joeweaver/SParMorIA-Sludge-Particle-Morphological-Image-Analysis) used to analyze activated sludge particle morphologies
* a [Jupyter notebook-based](https://github.com/joeweaver/get_to_know_phyloseq) system to interactively teach basic metagenomic data analysis and visualization.
