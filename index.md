I am a PhD candidate in the [de los Reyes](https://delosreyeslab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) and [Ducoste](https://www.ccee.ncsu.edu/people/jducoste) labs at North Carolina State University.  I am interested in improving microbially mediated waste treatment by using skills at the intersection of ecology, microbial biotechnology, and software engineering.

At home, I'm interested in good food, bad movies, and a variety of books.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Microbial community assembly
- Combined CFD-biokinetic modelling
- Shear-induced bioaggregation 
- Enhanced pedagogical techniques

You can read more details on my [research](/research) page.

## Education

- PhD Candidate, Civil Engineering, North Carolina State University (2019 expected)
- MS, Environmental Engineering, North Carolina State University (2013)
- BS, Electrical Engineering, Cornell University (2002)

The full listing can be seen on my CV ([html](/cv),[pdf](/cv/cv.pdf)).
