I am a Senior Research Associate working at Newcastle University with Dr. Tom Curtis as part of the UKRI [Environmental Biotechnlogy Innovation Centre](https://ebicentre.co.uk/) (EBIC). I am interested in improving microbially mediated systems, especially those concerning waste treatment, by using skills at the intersection of ecology, microbial biotechnology, and software engineering.

At home, I'm interested in good food, bad movies, and a variety of books.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Microbial community assembly
- Agent based modelling of microbial communities
- Type VI Secretion Systems (a.k.a. poison-tipped bacterial harpoons)
- Combined CFD-biokinetic modelling
- Shear-induced bioaggregation 
- Enhanced pedagogical techniques

You can read more details on my [research](/research) page.

## Education

- PhD, Civil Engineering, North Carolina State University (2021)
- MS, Environmental Engineering, North Carolina State University (2013)
- BS, Electrical Engineering, Cornell University (2002)

The full listing can be seen on my CV ([html](/cv),[pdf](/cv/cv.pdf)).
