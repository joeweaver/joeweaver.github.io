After my undergraduate education, my inner biology geek was re-awoken by a confluence of hobbies and conversations. I became enamored with the microbes which produced my compost, brewed my beer, and (honestly), lead to many interesting conversations about cholera. As an engineer, I was naturally drawn to their applications.  Not much has changed since I decided to turn my avocation into a career.

I am particularly interested in microbially mediated waste treatment and enjoy combining approaches from ecology, microbial biotechnology, and software engineering in my research.

## Current Projects
###  Microbial community assembly
Activated sludge plants contain a diverse community of microbes which do the actual work of treating wastewater. We have some idea of what a 'good' microbial community looks like, but our ability to direct assembly towards a desired community is limited. 


As an engineer, I am trying to use ecological models of community assembly to better understand how to produce desired microbial populations. As an ecologist, I am interested in using wastewater treatment as a controllable, yet complex, system for exploring the same models.

### Combined CFD-biokinetic modelling
Increased computing power has allowed computational fluid dynamics to flourish in many fields. In environmental engineering, it has been successful, but also largely limited to hydraulic modelling. There is a recognized need to explore different methods of including biokinetic reactions and other processes, such as sludge settling, into realistic models which can be computed in a practical amount of time.

Specifically, I am attempting to create an open, reproducible model which incorporates fluid flow, biological flocs, and ASM-style biokinetic models to predict reactor performance.

### Shear-induced bioaggregation 
The local shear microenvironment is a key parameter affecting biological particles. It influences local substrate concentrations, induces bacterial physiological responses, and physically shapes particles though erosion, fragmentation, aggregation.

I am involved in both the 'wet' work of evaluating reactors which allow better experimental control of shear rates and the 'dry' work of developing CFD models to evaluate the shear rate distributions within those reactors.

### Enhanced pedagogical techniques
Teaching is an essential component of academic life and while I do not believe the traditional stand-up lecture is a medieval torture device, I do believe that there are complementary methods which can improve our role as [*doctors*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/doctor#Etymology).

While another page explains my general [teaching philosophy](/teaching), a particular interest of mine is interactive tutorial sessions, such as one allowing students to [learn basic data analysis of microbial metagenomic studies](https://github.com/joeweaver/get_to_know_phyloseq).

## Previous Projects
## Anaerobic Plastic Degradation
With the explosion of 'biodegradable' plastics coming to the market, it is important to be clear about what biodegradable means and under what conditions the plastics actually degrade. In particular, it is important to evaluate methods designed to identify which plastics will biologically degrade in the warm, anaerobic environment of a landfill - the ultimate endpoint of much consumer waste.
